# car-damage-severity-classifire
I created three different classifier models using a pre-trained deep learning model(Inception model, residual network model, and VGG16 model) that classify the cars on damage severity and determine their accuracy and loss. By comparing all accuracy and loss, I found that the inception model is the best classifier with validation accuracy above 60%. But inception model has some demerit that shows high variance (high difference between training error and validation error). Yet, it is the best model out of all models.
